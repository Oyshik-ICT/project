        <span class="b1">Background of the Project:</span>
        <p class="a2">Dhaka-Chittagong National Highway is considered to be the most important highway and lifeline of
            commerce in Bangladesh and carries port and other traffic to Dhaka and other places in the country.
            The existing Dhaka-Chittagong Highway (N1) is 4-lane from Dhaka to Daudkandi except for
            Kanchpur, Meghna and Daudkandi Bridges, which are 2-laned. From Daudkandi onwards it is
            mostly 2-lane road on a plain terrain and will also be widened into 4 lane by the year 2013 under a
            separate project named 4 Laning of Dhaka-Chittagong Highway Project. Total AADT for motorised
            traffic is in the range of 31,276 to 42,890 PCU whereas total quantity of AADT including motorised
            and non-motorised traffic varies in the range of 35,615 and 44,785 PCU out of which 60% of
            commercial traffic and 27% of passenger vehicles are through traffic. So the Government has
            decided to construct an independent alignment of Dhaka-Chittagong Highway, a 4-lane divided
            carriageway with the provision of future 6-lane expansion capable of carrying containers and other
            traffic from the port city of Chittagong to the distribution center at the capital city of Dhaka with
            access control. It is envisaged that the implementation of such project will reduce journey time from
            Dhaka to Chittagong by approximately three (3) hours, reduce congestion, accidents, enhance safety
            and improve air quality of the surroundings.Presently the Roads and Highways Department, as executing authority of the Project, is actively
            involved in the process of engaging private sector for the construction of 2nd Dhaka-Chittagong
            National Highway (Expressway) in Bangladesh on Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) basis granting
            concession term of 30 years which shall commence on the first day of the commercial operation termed
            as Commercial Operations Date (COD) and prior to the commencement of the concession term, the
            investor shall also avail maximum of 5 years as construction period.</p>
        <span class="b1">Project Description</span>
        <p class="a2">
            Chittagong is the 2nd largest city of Bangladesh. It is known as the port city as
            well as the commercial capital of the country. Chittagong seaport is one of the
            two seaports of Bangladesh and it handles about 90 percent of the seaborne
            imports and exports of the country. So it has a great impact on the country’s
            export-import business. An efficient road communication between Chittagong
            and other parts of the country is extremely important for the country’s
            economic development. The existing Dhaka-Chittagong National Highway is
            a 2-lane single carriageway (except from the Mukti Sarani (Dhaka end) to
            Daudkandi section) which is currently being upgraded to a 4-lane carriageway.
            Considering the importance of this road, the Government of Bangladesh has
            appointed contractors under 10(ten) Roadwork Packages to upgrade this
            highway to a 2 dual lane (4-lane) carriageway to cater for the current traffic
            demand, capable of transporting heavy container traffic from the port of
            Chittagong to the capital city of Dhaka.
            The up-gradation of the existing Dhaka-Chittagong highway has already taken
            up and expected to be completed by GoB in 2013. However, a 2nd National
            Highway between Dhaka and Chittagong still needs to be developed to cope
            with the increased traffic volume as the traffic continues to increase to a great
            extent. If this 2nd highway (Expressway) is constructed and operated through
            private sector as a Public-Private Partnership project, then GoB, depending on
            the outcome of negotiation, may only be required to investment some amount
            from the public fund to facilitate its implement. The newly constructed
            highway will then be able to provide an efficient road transport system by
            reducing the travel time as well as providing high-level travel comfort and
            convenience. Additionally, the implementation of 2nd Dhaka-Chittagong
            National Highway (Expressway) will fulfil the future transport needs between
            these two important cities of the country and contribute to growth of our
            national economy 
        </p>
        <span class="b1">Objective:</span>
        <p class="a2">
            An adequate and efficient transport system is a pre-requisite to further
            economic development, for expansion and integration of markets and growth
            of international trade in Bangladesh. Dhaka-Chittagong National Highway is
            considered to be the most important highway and lifeline of commerce in
            Bangladesh and carries port traffic to Dhaka and other places in the country.
            This highway, however, is overloaded at the moment by reason of which the
            Government is willing to develop a 2nd corridor by constructing an
            expressway either at grade level or elevated one, whichever cost-effective,
            which is envisaged to provide substantial economic and social benefits to
            south-eastern region in particular through generation of employment,
            creation of improved facilities for trade and commerce, promotion of social
            integration and development of tourism and would thus assist economic
            development and reduction of poverty in the country.

        <span class="b1">Project Overview</span> 
        <p class="a2">
            Over 20,000 motorised vehicles use the highway each day, resulting in serious congestion, and as a result the 220 km journey can take up to 10 hours. Upon completion, the Dhaka-Chittagong Expressway will help to increase trade and reduce congestion on the existing highway.

            The project comprises a feasibility study to assess different route alignment options, economic and financial analysis for the follow-on project, and recommendation of the PPP structure, and concept, preliminary and detailed designs.

            The overall goal of this Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded project is to reduce journey times, improve road safety and accommodate future growth.
